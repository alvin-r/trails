It consists of 209 acres of forested rolling hills, and a large ledge offering an overlook of the Housatonic River.

200 million years ago, this region was covered by an ocean that featured a coral reef surrounding a volcanic island. Lava had covered the coral, which eventually turned into the marble/limestone seen today. Between around 1790-1820, local farmers mined the marble and burned it in a kiln to produce ""quick lime"" for their soil. The remains of the quarries and kiln can still be seen within the park. A very small natural cave network also exists on the property (hardly large enough to crawl in, but one of only a few such natural caves within CT). Due to this history and unique geology, the property is designated as a historic and ecological preserve. 

Little-Laurel Lime Ridge Park is freely open to the public for passive recreation only: walking, hiking, and bicycling. No motorized vehicles, camping, fires, or hunting. Parking and Trailhead is located at the end of Tibbets Road. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a leash.

The park's original trail system was two simple overlapping loops. This is depicted in the town's official trail guide. In recent years, several illegal trails have been constructed which overlap, cause erosion, damage the forest, disrupt wildlife, and simply confuse visitors. The town's trail committee has been working to close and remove most of them in an effort to help restore the forest. As of August 2020, the only officially marked trails are the boundary loop, which uses standard blazing in the color Blue, and the optional secondary entrance/exit at Partridge Road, which is Red.

The town has also reported an issue with ATV/OHV and dirt bike riders trespassing, marking trees, and causing other damage within the park. As a reminder, it is illegal within the state of CT to ride such vehicles on public streets and within state or municipal forests, parks, and open space designated for public use.

The trail is not well marked in some areas, downloading the map ahead of time is helpful for navigating."

To walk the trails at Black's Bluff, drive a little southwest of the (entirely inactive) quarries. There is a trail to the spring, unmarked at the road, but it's the last cable gate on the left before our property ends. 

You'll know you're in the right place because the big wooden ""Welcome to Black’s Bluff Preserve"" sign is about 20 yards down that trail, although it's difficult to see from the road. Once again, beware of fast traffic, and park beside the cable gate parallel to Black's Bluff Road with all your wheels off the road. 

If you pull straight down to the gate, you risk getting stuck on slick clay. Not ADA accessible.

The public trail, Spring Trail, will take you to the spring pools. It is moderately difficult and begins just beyond the preserve sign."

Kingfishers, tree swallows, and rusty blackbirds are also commonly spotted. The Great Marsh abounds in the diverse animal activity of a healthy wetland ecosystem. During the migration periods, the wetland will be frequented by flocks of ducks and geese. The wading birds like herons and egrets, and the songbirds such as warblers and red-winged blackbirds are abundant.

The Great Marsh is the largest interdunal wetland in the Lake Michigan watershed. It serves as critical habitat for breeding and migratory birds. This popular trail features an overlook of the marsh where you can spot a wide variety of birds ranging from Great Blue Herons to Sandhill Cranes. While much of the marsh was drained in the early 1900s for residential and agricultural use, the National Park Service began restoration of this portion in 1998. The diversity of plants, birds, and habitats signifies the return of a healthy wetland ecosystem after decades of neglect. Now restored, the Great Marsh's fens, sedge meadows, and wet prairies are again thriving and providing the natural filter to improve the area's water quality.

- Open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm.

The best way to do the first section of this trail is on bike, otherwise the beginning will be a road hike for roughly 3 miles. Once you get to the actual trail (which can be overgrown at times) there are places to hide you bike or lock it up among all of the Huckleberry bushes.

The initial ascent is pretty steep, you will climb a couple thousand feet in a hurry so make sure your boots are tight. Once you make it to the top of the trail; which is just below Sunday Mountain peak, you will go through a saddle with a gorgeous view of Grizzly Basin.

Continue along the trail and make your way through the upcoming small canyons and rock face traverses. Around 5.5 miles, be careful and watch your footing. This are is a rock slide scramble. The trail becomes very difficult to follow after descending from the pass - a few cairns are present but mostly you will rely on orienteering. Once you have passed the scramble it is all almost all down hill from there.

You have a small incline up through some lightly wooded areas that are awesome for seeing deer and wildlife at the right time of year, followed by a canyon descent essentially the remainder of the hike until you come to the spillway of George Lake. Camping along the lake is pretty easy, just find one of the many plentiful spots and set up."

Save your energy for the last quarter mile of the trail, as it's steep. When the trail divides, go right on the unmarked footpath.   About a half-dozen switchbacks leads to the top of Cathedral Rock.

There are eight fixed ropes if you go to the river; some are challenging, especially when coming back up. While dogs are allowed in this area, bringing them on this trail is not advisable due to the amount of scrambling required, which could be difficult for most dogs.

Your first obstacle is navigating a large boulder with what looks like a significant drop-off.  You'll see some steps in the rock wall to your right. There is a strap here to help you down the steps.

A short distance after this, the wash opens up as several washes come together. Keep walking down, and you'll come to the next rope. This goes down the left side of the rock wall, and you'll need to use the rope as intended and walk down backward while moving down the rope. There's a dry fall that some slide down. A blue arrow painted on the rocks to the left of the chute shows you how to walk around and down this dry fall.

After you have cleared these obstacles, you arrive at what once was the Upper Goldstrike Hot Springs pools, which have since dried up. A few pools farther down still have water, but you'll see the remnants of the pools that no longer have any source for filling."

Winter ascents of Incline Peak follow a snow-covered trail that climbs gradually through forested slopes with intermittent meadow openings. Expect steady elevation gain.

As you climb above treeline, the terrain opens, revealing sweeping views of Lake Tahoe and surrounding peaks. It is important to know that the trail enters avalanche terrain. A winter ascent takes about 4–6 hours depending on snow travel and breaks, and successful hikers commonly bring layers, proper winter gear (insulated boots, gaiters, poles), and navigation aids.

The trail is generally well defined and marked with orange diamonds or orange ribbon in a few spots. The trail starts out rocky as it winds its way around a flattened stone fence but quickly joins up with what was probably an old cart path used by the neighboring farm.

Right before that intersection there is a junction for the loop the trail makes but it is not well marked from this side. At approximately 0.75 of a mile the trail makes a sharp left onto a less wide but still well defined path through the woods. 

One does have to cross four tributaries to the Poestenkill but they are narrow and stepping stones can be found to cross over dryly. The trail comes to the Poestenkill opposite the southern terminus of the Creek Trail and then climbs a ridge alongside of the stream. While glimpses of the falls can be seen from the trail, hemlocks block a clear view.

The Flintlock Trail takes its name from a 19th century cart path that connected Plain Road to small farm, back in the woods. The trail is blazed yellow, and accessed via the Pond Trail, from the south end of the parking lot.

Heading east from the trail junction, note the parallel tracks worn in the ground by a century of horse-and-wagon traffic.  The old trail is even clearer where it passes through a gap in a stone wall, indicating that the land was once pastured.  About a half mile down the trail, a historic cemetery tells the story of the Ellis family, who farmed the area before the Civil War.  

Just past the cemetery, the trail winds through the old farmstead, which The Nature Conservancy partially opened up for songbird habitat in 2010.  Previous owners of property lived here into the late 1980s, before it was abandoned.  The trail turns left at a small farm pond, which was re-engineered as a family swimming hole in the 1970s.

Leaving the clearing, the trail passes through a grove of majestic white pines along a wide path covered with soft needles.  A side trail offers a look at a larger, secluded pond, which beavers help maintain today.  After a half-mile on this wide lane, the trail curves left into the woods, slipping past a red maple swamp.  

Climbing out of the lowlands, the Flintlock Trail emerges into open woods, where slow-growing oaks are giving way to more vigorous white pines.  At the top of a hill, hikers have a choice: check out more of the old pasture to the right or turn left and explore a boulder garden. Either way, this mile-long segment ends where Flintlock rejoins the Pond Trail. Continue straight ahead to complete a 3-mile loop, or turn right for a longer hike around Tillinghast Pond."

This trail features a variety of landscapes and habitats, which makes this area special within the Columbia River Gorge.

During the spring, this meadow is a beautiful place to emerge from the dense forest, as the warm spring sun allows for stunning wildflowers and views of nearby snow-capped mountains.

The trail gets narrower and more challenging as it climbs, so following the marked loop on the AllTrails map is the best way to enjoy different stunning views.

The first 3ish miles of the trail are a breeze as you meander along with the Dungeness river until you reach Camp Handy. From there you take a hard right and start your ascent. The ascent starts pretty gradual through the woods and then the grade becomes steep. You hike along a rockslide where the footing is loose and slick. Take your time and be careful! There are a lot of roots and uneven footing along this section. Soon after you pass this rockslide you get into a forest of dead trees where the grade eases up and is much less steep but a lot of deadfall litter the trail that creates obstacles to hike up and over or even underneath in some sections. As you approach a meadow your incline starts to increase again and the trail becomes more gravel than solid ground. There are almost no switchbacks which makes this climb challenging and steep Once you’ve pushed past this steep incline the grade starts to mellow out again and due to the vegetation typically around wetter environments, you can sense that you are near the lake. You have to make one final short push to get up and over into the bowl of the lake and once you do, you’ve made it.

Stone has three summits: the south and middle are Class 3, while the north summit is Class 2. This route detours off the Putvin Trail at Pond of the False Prophet. The rest of the route is off-trail and for experienced hikers and mountaineers. Download this map before you go, and make sure to do diligent research on other climbing websites with specific route beta."

The trail climbs through the forest and passes a steep rocky outcropping about a half mile from the trailhead. This spot is popular with rock climbers and you may notice climbing hardware hanging from the cliff. As you ascend you are rewarded with some views, the summit has a perfect view of Mt. Rainier."

https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/the-beehive-loop-trail,1.5,508,,loop,"The Beehive Trail Loop is one of the most popular hikes in Acadia National Park. This popular loop offers incredible views, with some challenging rung and ladder sections. This loop starts at the Sand Beach Parking Lot, traverses over the Beehive, reaches the Bowl Pond, and then loops back on the Bowl Trail.

The route should only be hiked in the counterclockwise direction. Going counterclockwise, you go up the rungs and ladders, which is much easier than going down them. Also, this way you get the climb out of the way early, and the rest is smooth sailing. The exposed granite can be very slippery when wet, so it is not recommended if it has recently rained.

Starting out from Sand Beach, the trailhead is across Park Loop Road. You’ll be on the Bowl Trail briefly, before turning right onto the Beehive Trail. This part of the trail requires scrambling, climbing ladders, steadying yourself with rungs, and ascending steep granite staircases. This section can be very challenging and is not recommended for people with a fear of heights. There are steep cliff drop-offs next to the trail.

After taking in the views from The Beehive, continue along the trail to the Bowl Pond. Along the way, you’ll see the Bowl Connector Trail on the left. This trail shortens the loop, if you’re starting to get tired or running out of time. If you take this connector, you will not be able to view the Bowl Pond.

After checking out the pond, return to the parking area along the Bowl Trail. This trail is much more gradual and does not require any scrambling."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/jordan-pond-path,3.3,62,,loop,"There are great views on a lot of the walk around the lake. This trail can get crowded at points, especially on the parts where there were narrower wooden walkways for paths. Go early, as it can be difficult to find a parking spot due to the traffic. The backdrop of the pond and bubbles are beautiful as you meander through the woods along the pond. The boardwalks are unique, and outside of a couple of muddy spots, this trail is very enjoyable.

There’s a section with some rocky terrain but other than that it’s a peaceful walk. There are a couple of sandy areas where people can step aside and relax on the shore.

Dogs, swimming, and wading are not allowed in the pond."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/gorham-mountain-loop,3,567,,loop,"The Gorham Mountain Loop is a wonderful hike that will take you over mountain ledges, along the shore of the Atlantic, and the iconic Sand Beach. 

From the Gorham Mountain Trailhead you will go up and over the ledges of Gorham Mountain while taking in ocean views. After descending the mountain and meeting the Bowl Trail, you will cross over to the Sand Beach Parking lot and take the Ocean Path past Thunder Hole. 

Continue walking past Thunder Hole and look for a stump with Gorham Mountain carved into it, once you arrive here they will cross the road one more time and arrive back at the trailhead. 

Even in winter, this is an absolutely gorgeous hike, with some of the prettiest views to be seen. Though, it is important to wear proper winter footwear, such as boots, since there are a few sections that are very slippery."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/ocean-path-trail--2,4.1,337,1.5–2hr,out & back,"Starting at the south end of the upper Sand Beach Parking lot, the easy 2.2 mile mostly flat one-way Ocean Path trail parallels the loop road all the way to Otter Point.  The path offers scenic views and numerous access points to outcroppings above the rocky shore, including major attractions like Thunder Hole and Otter Cliff.  Great trail to stroll or to deviate and explore the best Acadia has to offer.  Get to the area early before any tour buses or late around sunset and you can have the shoreline mostly all to yourself.

Some more on exploring along the path:  
Half-way between Sand Beach and Otter Cliff is Thunder Hole. Waves and tides dictate whether you hear the sound like thunder or whether you'll hear a whisper of waves crashing below. Granite stairs and railings lead to the viewing area.

Half way between Thunder Hole and Otter Cliffs on the right side of the Park Loop Road, is the small parking area for the Gorham Mountain Trail, which offers spectacular panoramic views of the eastern coastline. From this vantage point (another 2 mi. RT deviation to the summit), you can see from Sand Beach to the north and all the way south to Otter Cliff.

At the southern end of the path is Otter Cliff. Just before Otter Cliff is Monument Cove. Look for the short side trail on the left as there are some great photo ops from this vantage point, especially when the first light of the morning turns the cliffs a golden color.  Rock climbers and rappellers frequent the Otter Cliff.  This is a great hike - take as little or as much time as you like to explore!

The trail is not well marked in some areas, downloading the map ahead of time is helpful for navigating."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/cadillac-north-ridge-trail--3,4.2,1148,,out & back,"This trail goes to the highest point in Acadia National Park. To get to the start of the hike, you may need to park before a closed section of the park loop road nearest the trailhead. From there, you take the Kebo Trail for a little bit, and then there's a sign to the start of the Cadillac North Ridge Trail. You will stay on this trail until you reach the summit and use it to descend back to the trailhead. 

From the top Schoodic Peninsula and Frenchman Bay are visible. This hike is popular for sunrise and sunset so hikers should remember to bring appropriate layers and a headlamp."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/beehive-gorham-mountain-and-ocean-path-loop,3.4,784,,loop,"This hike involves scaling ladders and scrambling, making it very technical. 

Along the way visitors will enjoy views from atop The Beehive and Gorham Mountain, and walk alongside The Bowl pond and Atlantic Ocean. 

It is recommended to do this hike counter clockwise so hikers are ascending the ladders on The Beehive rather than descending them."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/cadillac-south-ridge-trail--2,7,1581,,out & back,"Cadillac Mountain is known for its spectacular views, especially at sunrise. This route begins in a parking lot near the Blackwoods Campground and is one of the longest stretches of trail on Mount Desert Island. There is also an access trail from the campground itself. The true summit is to the left where the South Ridge Trail opens onto the gravel access road. Look for two survey benchmarks established by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1856 and 1954.

The Cadillac Mountain South Ridge Trail, or Cadillac South Ridge Trail, is a gradual climb that does not meet Cadillac Summit Road until the very end. The trail briefly descends to a small pond called The Featherbed, where there is a wooden bench for taking a break and enjoying the pond. On the return, descend back down the Cadillac South Ridge Trail.

If you’d prefer not to hike Cadillac Mountain, you can drive up Cadillac Summit Road and there is a parking area and gift shop at the top. 

Although dogs are allowed on this trail, visitors have reported that there are some very rocky, steep sections that may be difficult for your dog."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/jordan-pond-path-and-south-bubble,3.5,508,,loop,"From the Jordan Pond boat ramp, walk alongside the eastern banks of the pond. 

This trail will lead to the base of South Bubble, hike and scramble up this trail and enjoy the views from the summit of South Bubble. 

Descend back down South Bubble and follow the western bank of Jordan Pond back to the trailhead.

There is a short section with iron rungs on South Bubble, the National Park lists this as a trail not recommended for bringing dogs on."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/precipice-loop,2.7,1000,,loop,"The Precipice Trail is a difficult and very steep loop trail using iron rungs and ladders on exposed cliffs providing spectacular views of Acadia National Park.

The hike is not recommended during wet conditions, or if you experience vertigo; also not recommended for small children. The trail starts up steps and through some boulder scrambles. While officially a non-technical hike due to strategically placed iron rungs, ladders and rock ledges, this is really a climb that requires you to be able to navigate some tricky spots by pulling yourself up (e.g. the very first example of this might even be the hardest). If you are careful and pay attention, this will be a great and thrilling experience. Leave hiking poles behind, as you won't need them and they'll just get in the way. One of the very best short hikes in Acadia, similar to what you get on Katahdin's Knife Edge."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maine/cadillac-summit-loop-trail--2,0.4,65,0.5–1hr,loop,"Experience some of the most stunning views in Acadia National Park on the very top of Cadillac Mountain! The Cadillac Summit Loop Trail is a short, paved path that's great for families and is designed to be accessible, making it easy for many people to enjoy the amazing scenery. You'll see breathtaking sights of Frenchman Bay, the charming Porcupine Islands, and the vast Atlantic Ocean. It's a wonderful spot to get your bearings and see how the mountains meet the sea.

Cadillac Mountain is famous for being one of the first places in the United States to see the sunrise at certain times of the year, so it can be a popular morning destination! The mountaintop is made of beautiful pink granite, smoothed by ancient glaciers. Look around for hardy plants that can survive the windy conditions, like low-bush blueberries, cranberries, and tough little spruce trees. You might also spot birds like peregrine falcons soaring by. Remember that it can be much cooler and windier at the summit than down below, so bringing an extra layer is always a good idea, even in summer.

The National Park Service maintains this trail.

https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/delicate-arch-trail,3.2,629,1.5–2hr,out & back,"Delicate Arch Trail is a short hike in Arches National Park to Utah's most recognizable natural arch, which you will likely recognize from the Utah license plate. The park is home to some of the most unique geologic features in the world. This fantastic hiking trail leads along the red rock slabs to the largest free standing arch in the park. You’ll pass smaller stone arches, piles of balanced rocks, and tall sandstone fins on your way to this incredible rocky feature.

The parking lot is located on Delicate Arch Road. From the parking area, you’ll set off from the Delicate Arch Trailhead and cross the bridge over salt wash. This route is best hiked in spring and fall when the temperatures are cooler, or during the golden hours just after sunrise and before sunset when the rocks seem to turn a magical color and the air temperature is comfortable.

There is no shade along this trail, so be sure to bring some water and a hat. The route begins as a well defined trail, but does cross areas of open slick rock with exposure to heights. The final walk to the Delicate Arch itself is along exposed, open slickrock and can be dangerous without the proper footwear or experience. 

Visiting Delicate Arch is a must when in Arches National Park. Parking is limited and can fill up quickly during peak tourism months so make sure to arrive early. Those looking for a shorter hike can drive to the end of Delicate Arch Road and walk to Upper Delicate Arch Viewpoint, providing a unique but more distant view of the arch."

The trail offers incredible views of unique arches, including Landscape Arch, which is one of the longest natural spans in the world.

The trailhead is at the end of the main road through the park. There is a large parking area, but during busy weekends it can be difficult to find parking.

The mapped route on this page traverses the area counter-clockwise, with many side trips to the various arches. You can skip the side trips to lessen the distance or difficulty level. The main trail through Devils Garden is well maintained and wide. Some of the side trips require scrambling, and are not good for children or those afraid of heights.

The counter-clockwise route visits the following arches in this order: Tunnel Arch, Pine Tree Arch, Private Arch, Dark Angel Arch, Double O Arch, Partition Arch, Navajo Arch, and finally Landscape Arch."

To get to Double O Arch, the trail starts at the Devil's Garden parking lot and passes by Landscape Arch first. The Devil's Garden trail is well-maintained and flat until you pass by the Landscape Arch. After passing Landscape Arch, the terrain on the trail becomes rugged and rocky. There are some drop-offs and steep inclines along this section of trail. Most of the trail has no shade, so it is recommended to start early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day."

To get there, you must drive just over nine miles up Main Park Road from the Visitor Center and take your first right after Balanced Rock. This parking lot fills up early. A staircase across the road from the trailhead connects to an upper parking lot, wheelchair-accessible restrooms, and the Windows Trailhead. 

There is much to see in this area of the park. Nearby landmarks include the Parade of Elephants, Cove of Caves, the Windows, Turret Arch, Cove Arch, Ribbon Arch, and Elephant Butte.

Along the Queen’s Garden Trail, you’ll have the opportunity to walk among the towering hoodoos and rocky formations. Hoodoos go through several stages throughout the course of their formation. First, water erodes the sides of rocky plateaus until they become fins. Once they are thinned out from significant erosion, holes form in their center, creating a window.  Finally, after further erosion, the top of the windows break away, leaving a hoodoo in its place. In Bryce, most erosion occurs from ""frost wedging"".  Rain seeps into cracks of the rocks, and when the temperature drops the water freezes and expands, which creates larger cracks in the rocks."

The trail also provides access to Water Canyon in one direction and to view a sheltered overhang known as Mossy Cave in the other. This area is filled with mosses in the summer and icicles in the winter.

The varied and colorful rock formations that surround this hoodoo, are described as many sculptures and other ornaments within the Queen's ""Garden"". Of the six trails that descend into the Bryce Amphitheater, the Queen's Garden Trail is considered the least strenuous; though due to the park's high elevation and steep grades in some areas, it is still categorized as a moderately strenuous hike. The trail also provides views of a grove of bristlecone pines near the Horse Trail junction.

Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth. You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years."

Photographers and sunrise-chasers love this spot, so an early start is often recommended by other visitors if you want to beat the crowds. The path is a loop and pretty easy, though it can be a little uneven with some rocks and stairs, so watching your step is always wise.

You're hiking on what's called the ""Island in the Sky"" mesa, a massive flat-topped piece of land with steep cliffs all around. Look around at the plants – you might see hardy Utah Junipers and Pinyon Pines, which are common in these pinyon-junioper woodlands. Perhaps you'll notice some Mormon Tea, a plant pioneers used to brew a drink from. Wildlife here is often active at dawn or dusk, but you could see rock squirrels or various birds during your walk. Historically, this whole area was home to Ancestral Puebloan people, and later, miners and ranchers explored this rugged land. While this trail is short, the view through Mesa Arch feels timeless.

The rocks along the trail tilt away from the dome as a result of the impact. Upheaval Dome doesn't fit with the rest of the Canyonlands terrain. It's obviously not the result of gradual erosion like the rest of the park, but rather a dramatic deformity in which rocks have been pushed into a domelike structure. Some of this route requires rock scrambling and navigating routes along slick-rock that aren't marked.

Starting as a strenuous climb up switchbacks for the first quarter-mile; then it becomes a moderate loop hike afterward offering views of Chimney Rock and sweeping panoramas from the top of the mesa along the edge of the Waterpocket Fold. Chimney Rock is a natural spire, eroded out of the side of the mesa, and stands 300 ft above the road. The trail ascends higher than the top of the chimney. After a 300-ft climb, the loop trail more gradually ascends and circles the top of Mummy Cliff to the south of Chimney Rock. Since this is a loop, go whichever direction you wish, but most people end up going counterclockwise to finish the climb at the beginning of the loop trail to the cliffs. Chimney Rock was once part of the same sediment bed solidified into Mummy Cliff and the rest of the mesa. But as the mesa eroded, Chimney Rock - made of harder stone - is positioned such that it can shrug off the mesa's winds and stone-splitting frosts; it formed a natural landmark more resistant to erosion than the surrounding sandstone. 

Chimney Rock Canyon is located on the east side of the mesa and cuts way down to Spring Canyon, and then onto Hwy 24 and the Fremont River.  Seemingly made of stacked sandstone bricks, Mummy Cliffs almost appear to be a buttress holding up edges of the mesa. The cliffs mark the highest point of the mesa, rising up out of Chimney Rock Canyon with the rest of the slanted Waterpocket Fold.  The hike can be extremely hot in the summer, so be sure to take plenty of water; also hiking poles are useful.

The first European settlers, fishermen, and sheep ranchers arrived in the 1800s. The Coast Guard built the last permanent light station on the west coast in 1932. Protection for the island began in 1938 when Anacapa Island (along with Santa Barbara Island) became a national monument. In 1980 it was designated as part of Channel Islands National Park. The island waters are protected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the State of California. 

No off-trail hiking is permitted. Visitors should stay back from cliffs and should not rock climb as the cliffs and rock faces are very unstable."

There are two ways to do this hike. You can start at the Grinnell Glacier Trailhead, and hike the six miles to the glacier. Another option is to take a boat from the Many Glacier Hotel. The boat crosses Swiftcurrent Lake, and then another boat takes you across Lake Josephine. This option shortens the hike by about 3.5 miles roundtrip. More information about the boat can be found here: http://glacierparkboats.com/

After either hiking around Lake Josephine or taking the boat, the hike becomes steep and the challenge begins. Almost a mile after the lake, you’ll start to see Grinnell Lake below you. You’ll also see Mount Gould towering above you to the south, and eventually Grinnell Falls dropping hundreds of feet down above the lake. This part of the hike is incredibly scenic, passing through alpine meadows, with smaller waterfalls and Mount Grinnell on your right. You’ll climb some switchbacks, and you’ll start to see Grinnell Glacier above you.

You’ll soon reach a section of the trail with steep drop-offs. After a series of even steeper switchbacks, you’ll finally reach Grinnell Glacier Viewpoint. Here you can take in incredible views of the 150-acre glacier, Garden Wall, Grinnell Lake, Mount Gould, and Gem Glacier. Once you’ve taken in the scenery, return the way you came. Some hikers choose to hike the whole way in, and then take the boat only on the return trip."

https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/texas/guadalupe-peak-texas-highpoint-trail,8,2936,,out & back,"This route up Guadalupe Peak is rewarding, although a very strenuous hike. It will take from 6 to 8 hours to complete the round-trip hike. The hike provides fantastic views from the highest point in the state of Texas (8,749). It also introduces hikers to several of the park’s ecosystems including the high desert and the high-elevation forests.

The trail starts at the RV section of the Pine Springs Campground (1/2 mile from the Pine Springs Visitor Center check-in at the visitor center, then turn right out of the visitor center parking lot). Follow the signs for Guadalupe Peak Trail. Follow the hiker trail; the horse trail will add about 1 extra mile to the trip (although it is less steep).

You will encounter the steepest part of the hike in the first mile and a half, as the trail switchbacks up the first steep slope. Be sure not to cut across the switchbacks, as this causes accelerated erosion. The views will get better with every switchback you climb.

After about a mile and a half, the trail becomes less steep as it passes a cliff and then turns around to the north-facing slope. Here, hikers will discover a small forest of pinion pine, southwestern white pine, and Douglas fir. The forest exists here because on a north-facing slope, there is not as much sunlight. The slightly cooler and shadier climate allows these pines to survive.

After nearly three miles, the trail tops out at a false summit. It is still a little more than a mile to the actual summit. The trail flattens out for a short distance as it passes through a sparse forest of ponderosa pine. The backcountry campsite for overnight backpackers is on this summit.

After passing the backcountry campsite, the trail descends slightly and crosses a wooden bridge. After the bridge, the trail begins the final climb to the summit. After only a few switchbacks, the top of El Capitan will dominate the view to the south. Eventually, you will pass the horse-hitching posts and arrive at the summit, where on a clear day you will be rewarded with a tremendous view of the surrounding mountains and desert.

Guadalupe Mountains National Park offers a diversity of flora and fauna. It also has numerous other hiking trails and recreational activities."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/texas/devils-hall,3.8,603,,out & back,"The Devil's Hall Trail, found in Guadalupe Mountains National Park, presents a moderately challenging hiking experience leading to a distinctive rock formation known as Devil's Hall. This trail is accessible throughout the year and is favored for both camping and hiking. Those who venture here can anticipate scenic views of the high desert, accompanied by a variety of plant and animal life. In the spring, the trail is enhanced by the blooming flora of the area.

It's important to note that the trail involves some rock scrambling, particularly in the wash area, which requires caution, especially when wet. The wash surface consists of loose gravel and rocks, so hikers should proceed carefully.

The different habitats you'll see along the trail help make Indiana Dunes National Park one of the most biologically diverse of all the national parks. Perhaps no other area in the park will take you through as many diverse habitats in such a short trail.

From the parking lot trailhead, head south with a short tour through a foredune complex on sandy soil. Foredunes contain many pioneer plants such as marram and little bluestem grasses and cottonwood trees. These plants are specially adapted to live in the dunes where moving sand sometimes partially buries or uncovers plant stems and roots. Although those grasses may seem hearty, they may die when stepped upon. Able to withstand battering by sand and wind, grasses will eventually succumb to the shade of taller plants providing the necessary soil for the oak forest that lies ahead.

The route transitions into an oak savanna with a more stable soil structure, which provides better footing. At the junction with the loop trail, turn left to hike the loop in the clockwise direction.

While other California volcanoes look conical like Mount Shasta, Lassen is a hub of volcanic activity with different vents erupting over the years. It is considered a ‘Lava Dome’. Mount Lassen and Mount St. Helens are the only volcanoes in the US to erupt in the 20th century. 

Mount Lassen is a towering testament to the volcanic origins of this region, and an imposing sight from the trailhead on the shores of Lake Helen. 

Starting at the parking lot at roughly 8,450 ft, the Lassen Peak trail makes a steep climb to the summit of Lassen Peak. The hike can be difficult, but the views are well worth the effort. It is truly a worth-while adventure to the top of an active volcano. This is one of the most popular trails in the Cascade Range. 

On the main road through Lassen National Park, a parking lot at the trailhead marks the beginning of the journey. The trail starts at 8500 feet in elevation and ascends quickly. The high altitude in combination with the steep ascent can make this hike difficult, but the trail is relatively short, a mere 2.5 miles in each direction. There are no trees to shade the hike, so be prepared for direct sunlight the entire trip. The trail remains a popular destination, because of its spectacular views, and the bragging rights of climbing this active volcano. Take care of volcano hazards."

Some are in plain sight and others are overgrown and hidden by forest, but none are more recent and more spectacular than the Cinder Cone that created the Fantastic Lava Beds and the colorful Painted Dunes eleven miles north east of Lassen Peak.

Sometime around the middle of the seventeenth century a volcanic vent in this area began to expel small chunks of lava, which cooled in mid-air and fell back to earth to collect into a cone some 700 feet in height. Activity finally ceased when larger amounts of lava flowed up to the surface and eventually blocked the vent. Standing on the summit of this 350 year old mound of tiny rocks, you're now free to explore the criss-crossing trails which circle the rim without any fear of danger. Should you wish, you can even journey to the exact center of crater well below the summit."

In fact, it was an enormous rockfall collapse of Chaos Crags which cut off a local creek and created this lake.

This spot is favored not only by hikers and photographers but also fishing enthusiasts in search of rainbow, brown and brook trout. Thankfully the lake is limited to non-motorized boats, keeping the lakeside relatively quiet.  Kayaks can be rented near the boat launch area - check the nearby campground store for details.

The trailhead is located close to the north entrance of the park.  Take a turn off the 44 toward Manzanita Lake campground (just next to the visitor center and museum) and the start of the trail is at the first bend in the road.  

There's only room for a handful of cars at the trailhead, but there's plenty more spaces available back at the visitor center, or further down the road towards the campground store and restrooms.

In geological terms the landscape of Lassen Volcanic National Park is about as young as it gets, and for an example you need look no further than Chaos Crags, a mountain of pink dacite that sprouted from the earth only a thousand years ago.

The trail head is located by the Bear Gulch Visitor Center and is best reached from the east entrance of the park. 

The High Peaks Trail at Pinnacles National Monument threads its way through the wreckage of a volcano destroyed by the San Andreas Fault millions of years ago.

The Monument, about 100 miles south of San Jose, California, celebrates the strange assortment of rock formations created as the volcano gave way to greater forces of plate tectonics. 

This loop from the eastern entrance of the Pinnacles provides the most direct route to the High Peaks, where a series of ladders and multiple tight squeezes take hikers through a geological maze that has made the Pinnacles a favorite among  hikers from throughout California. 

While the rocks and expansive vistas are the main attractions, you might get lucky and spot some of the rare California condors that nest in the park and soar high above. 

Trails on this hike: 

Condor Gulch Trail; High Peaks Trail; Bear Gulch Trail. 

Starting from the Bear Gulch parking area, you can go either way. Condor Gulch Trail is a bit steeper, so you may want to start out there to get your climbing done on fresh legs and spare your knees on the way down. The trail passes by Bear Gulch Reservoir and the Bear Gulch Caves. 

Best time to go: Springtime adds wildflowers to the awesome scenery, making it a near perfect hike. Summer will be too hot and autumn may be too dry, but winter should be gorgeous if you give the trails a couple days to dry out after passing storm systems. There are steep and narrow sections of the trail that require some technical footing. 

Caves in the area tend to close seasonally due to weather conditions and the presence of wildlife. To view updated closure information, please see https://www.nps.gov/pinn/planyourvisit/cavestatus.htm"

Hike the whole length of the High Peaks Trail to find out why it's the most popular Pinnacles trail. High Peaks Trail is a rugged route through the remarkable rock features of Pinnacles National Monument, which was formed millions of years ago when the San Andreas Fault shattered a volcano. 

While many hike options at the Pinnacles include parts of High Peaks Trail, this loop takes in the entire trail. This loop combines the Bear Gulch Trail, Bench Trail, and High Peaks Trail. 

The main attractions are the jungle gym of stairs, steps, and close quarters along the top of the trail, but the ascent to the top is well worth checking out too. Take the Bench Trail first and gradually climb upward with awesome vistas all the way up. If fortune smiles, you might catch sight of the rare California condors that soar above the park.  

Best time to go: Springtime adds wildflowers to the awesome scenery, making it a near-perfect hike. Summer will be too hot and autumn may be too dry, but winter should be gorgeous if you give the trails a couple of days to dry out after passing storm systems."

Moro Rock is an impressive geologic feature that can be viewed from above or below.

To reach the top of the dome and the famous viewpoint, you can either take this trail from the Giant Forest Museum parking area, or take a shuttle to the famous 300-foot staircase to the summit. For the much shorter staircase route that is considered to be the main Moro Rock summit route, please visit: https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/moro-rock--3

This route will take you through beautiful giant sequoia forests, climbing only slightly in elevation until you reach the main Moro Rock parking area and trailhead for the staircase route to the summit. From the top, you’ll see the Great Western Divide peaks, the San Joaquin Valley, and the wilderness of Sequoia National Park. Consider summiting Moro Rock at dawn or before dusk for a real treat. It offers a huge expanse of night sky, a rare view in forested parts of the parks. This route is one of the best places in the parks to see sunset and moonrise.

Moro Rock is one of several granite domes in these parks. These domes formed millions of years ago when magma beneath the surface cooled into granite. Since erosion removed the layers of softer rock that were above them, they have been rebounding and lifting a tiny bit each year.

Although the Giant Forest area is open year round, this is best done in the summer months. In winter, ski trails lead to the Moro Rock parking area, but the staircase to the summit itself is closed due to hazardous conditions."

https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/old-rag-mountain-loop-trail,9.2,2608,,loop,"Permits are needed to hike Old Rag March through November and must be reserved in advance. 

This hike, although challenging, is one of the most popular hikes in Shenandoah National Park. It has been referred to as a “brutally awesome” hike by many. Your climb to the peak includes many rocky switchbacks, so you will not be going straight up, but the trails are still at a steep grade. The descent, which will be slightly longer than your ascent, is a much more gradual grade that ends on a fire trail.

To start, check-in at the fee station. The trailhead is immediately to the left of it. To find the trailhead in Apple Maps, enter “Old Rag Trailhead”; for Google Maps, enter “Old Rag Mountain Fee and Information Station” as the destination. Follow the trail over the footbridge and begin your nearly three-mile ascent along switchbacks before reaching the boulder scramble section. There are handwritten numbers below some of the blue trail blazes throughout the trail. You’ll be going up, down, in between, around, and underneath granite boulders throughout the scramble. While going through the rock scrambling, keep your eyes open for the blue blazes, as sometimes they are in strange places.

Throughout your journey to Old Rag Mountain, each time you think you’ve reached the summit – you haven’t! This mountain has several false summits. You’ll know that you’ve reached the Old Rag Summit when you see the brown ‘Old Rag Mountain’ sign. Find a lovely rock with a fabulous 360 degree view for your lunch spot here before starting your descent back down by way of the Saddle Trail.

Heading down, you’ll pass two shelters (day-use only). First is the Byrds Nest Shelter, then the Old Rag Shelter before hitting a junction (there are 2 porta-johns here). Stay to your right to continue back on the Weakley Hollow Fire Road for about four miles to return to the parking lot. Watch for yellow blazes in this area. You will pass through beautiful forests and see Brokenback Run that leads into the Hughes River.

This is a challenging hike that will take most hikers 5-6 hours. It is highly recommended that you bring plenty of water on your trip. Hiking Old Rag is an adventure that should be on every Virginia hiker’s bucket list."

This is a very popular hike at mile 50.7 of Skyline Drive that starts at the Dark Hollow Falls parking area. There are some sitting rocks along the trail if you need to rest especially on your way back up. In the spring the blossoms of Mountain Laurel adorn the path with bright pink blossoms. The trail follows the Hogcamp Branch stream as it leaves the Big Meadows spring and eventually drops over the falls. The trail is cool and shaded by a canopy of trees that offers welcome relief in the summer. As you are hiking down listen to the sounds of the water and also to the sounds of nature. One of the birds that may serenade your hike is the Blue-Headed Vireo. This neotropical migrant that breeds at high elevations in the park has a very sweet melodious voice that seems to say ""Look-Up, In-the-Trees"". If you happen to see a dragonfly it may be one of the uncommon species that require pristine, shaded mountain streams. When you spot one of these you know you are in a special place. Near the bottom of the trail, you will come to a viewing platform where you can see the top of the falls. If you continue another tenth of a mile down the trail you will reach the base of the falls for a much more impressive view. Legend says that Thomas Jefferson was quite fond of these falls and spent time quietly contemplating the wonders of nature at the foot of Dark Hollow falls."

There are lots of waterfalls and a great panoramic view atop Hawksbill. The trail is rocky in some spots on the AT portion. Not very steep over most of the trail except for the ascent. Hikers say the best view is from the rocks on the upper portion of the Salamander Trail right before it connects into the Summit Trail.

From the north end of the Hawksbill Gap Parking Area (mile 45.5), take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.). At the trail post, turn left onto the A.T. south. Continue on the A.T. south to the trail post indicating the Salamander Trail. Go left onto the blue-blazed Salamander Trail. At the next trail junction, turn left onto the Upper Hawksbill Trail.

From the parking lot, begin hiking from the Upper Hawksbill Trailhead. This trail has blue blazes.  The lower portion of the trail is very wide and well maintained and follows a gradual slope that makes for relatively easy hiking.  The trail is heavily wooded, so no views are available, but wildlife sightings are possible.

About three-fourths of the way up, the trail levels off and turns northwest for a few hundred yards.  The trail actually goes slightly downhill before intersecting the Hawksbill fire road.  Turn right on fire road, which heads northeast to the summit.

The park fire road is steeper and rockier than the rest of the trail, so the hiking is more difficult.  The first sign that you have reached the summit is a Byrd's Nest shelter.  From the Byrd's nest, follow the signs to the summit, which has a stone observation platform.

The views from the summit are well worth the hike, and include commanding views of Betty's Rock to the northeast, Old Rag Mountain to the east, and the Shenandoah Valley to the west.  One could easily spend thirty to sixty minutes at the summit, so allow time to enjoy the view.  To return to the parking lot, retrace your steps."

Of the 5,000 square miles of glacial ice in Wrangell-St. Elias, the Root Glacier is the most accessible. A moderate walk from the historic mining town of Kennecott leads you onto the glacier. Be aware that glaciers can be dangerous. It is necessary to wear crampons or ice spikes on your shoes and go with an experienced guide.

In addition to getting to explore the glacier, you'll have great views of Mt. Blackburn, Regal Mountain, and Donaho Peak. Once you've walked about a mile and a half, access the glacier by turning left at the sign and following the trail as it winds down the moraine to the toe of the glacier. This trail crosses Amazon Creek, which is a seasonal stream. Depending on recent rainfall or spring melt, you may need to cross this stream.

Avoid walking along the edge of Root Glacier as rotting ice and swift, cold water are potentially dangerous. Bears are also present along the entire route."

If you only have time for one hike while in Yosemite look no further - the Mist Trail is the hike for you. It is no wonder why this trail is one of the most traveled in Yosemite National Park. You will hike so close to these two massive waterfalls that you may get wet from the trail. The best time to hike this trail is in Spring or early Summer, while the snow runoff is high and the falls are full of water.

The Mist Trail starts at Happy Isles Trailhead (YARTS Happy Isles shuttle stop #16, and within walking distance of Curry Village and the parking lot). The park recommends starting early to avoid the larger crowds. After a brief stroll along the river, you climb a pretty steep initial accent over stone steps until you reach the footbridge, which offers the first glimpse of Vernal Falls in the distance. You will also find a water fountain and restrooms. You will then continue up to Vernal Falls, past Emerald Pool, and alongside Nevada Falls until you reach the high-point of this hike.

You can choose to take the alternate route down along the John Muir Trail to see great views of Nevada Falls and Liberty Cap in the distance before meeting back up with the Mist Trail near the footbridge. This route back is slightly longer, but offers a change of scenery and is easier on the knees. Before hopping back on the YARTS shuttle, treat yourself to some ice cream or a refreshing drink at the small stand, or head over to Curry Village for a larger variety of choices."

Yosemite Falls, dropping 2,425 feet to the bottom of the valley from the top, is one of the most visited places in Yosemite National Park. The falls consist of three sections: upper falls, middle cascade, and lower falls. While most people only make the short trip to visit lower falls, upper falls is definitely worthy of visiting due to its panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the opportunity to see this amazing waterfall up close.  

The Yosemite Falls Trail is about 4 miles one way, gaining approximately 3,000 feet in elevation over the course of the climb. You’ll start near the famous Camp 4 and begin ascending along switchbacks through the trees. Take a look at the rocky cliffs of Eagle Peak to your left. This is a popular rock climbing wall and is also inhabited by eagles. At the Lower Gate, you’ll have a great photo op of the falls with views of Half Dome in the background.

Once you get to the top of the valley you can go to Yosemite Fall Overlook, a small platform near the mouth of Upper Yosemite Falls, to enjoy the thrilling views of looking down from above. The views of the valley from here are truly incredible. Those with the energy remaining can choose to go to Yosemite Point for some great views of North Dome and the rest of the valley.

If you only do one hike in Yosemite, then the trip to Upper Yosemite Falls is a great option. Although challenging, you’ll be rewarded with amazing views of the valley, Half Dome, and Sentinel Dome while climbing alongside one of the world’s tallest waterfalls.

The trail is generally open for the whole year but can be difficult to hike in winter due to snow, especially beyond Columbia Rock.

While pleasant at any time of year, Mirror Lake is fullest in spring and early summer. When water is calm, the lake offers beautiful reflections of surrounding cliffs. Mirror Lake is often referred to as Mirror Meadow in late summer due to the lack of water. 

The first mile of this trail is a paved service road that leads directly to Mirror Lake. You may access the loop trail from the end of the paved path. The loop follows Tenaya Creek beyond the lake, and crosses two bridges after the Snow Creek Trail junction before returning past Mirror Lake on the south side of Tenaya Canyon. (There is no safe access to the north side of Mirror Lake directly from the south side of the loop, except via bridges at the west and east ends of the trail).

Caution: When hiking on the south side of the loop, hikers often spot what appears to be an easy way to rock-hop across Tenaya Creek, either just for fun, or as a way to shortcut the loop and rejoin the trail without doing the entire loop. While this crossing is only ankle deep at first, it quickly becomes thigh deep, and, all too often, hikers are swept into dangerous whitewater and pinned against rocks. Don't be tempted to leave the trail, and always remember when approaching moving water to look at the conditions downstream."

The incredible views of Zion Canyon make this hike the most popular in Zion.

You'll start by parking at The Grotto Trailhead or taking the West Rim Shuttle to The Grotto shuttle stop. You'll cross a bridge over the Virgin River onto the West Rim Trail. The first few miles of this route along the West Rim Trail are on a paved path. Most of the path is sunny, but Refrigerator Canyon offers shade and often a cool breeze.

Eventually, you’ll come to Walter's Wiggles, a set of 21 switchbacks that take their name from Walter Ruesch, Zion National Park’s first superintendent.

Anchored support chains are attached along some sections of the sheer cliff to assist your way up and down the carved steps. You are rewarded with an excellent view of the main canyon at the top.

Heads up! It is a good idea to avoid standing near the edge at all times and avoid hiking this trail when it is wet, storming, or high winds are present. The route exposes hikers to steep drop-offs along cliff edges. You'll want to budget extra time for this route due to its technical sections.

You can also visit the historic Gamlin Cabin and walk inside the Fallen Monarch Sequoia as you travel along this paved trail. Wayside exhibits along the trail offer insights into the history and natural wonders of this area in both English and Spanish. After you witness these giant sequoias, you can also explore other nearby groves, such as Redwood Mountain and North Grove.

Visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers may need all-terrain tires or adaptive/motorized equipment for the surface type and grade. There is 1 designated van-accessible parking space in the paved parking lot with striped access aisles. The trail surface is paved asphalt, typically at least 6 feet wide. This trail is estimated to be mostly gentle (5% or less), with some steeper sections that may require assistance or need to be avoided. There are benches along the route at pullouts for resting.

https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mist-falls,7.9,908,3.5–4hr,out & back,"This popular route starts along the sandy Paradise Valley Trail, and then continues onto the Mist Falls Trail. As you climb into the wilderness, you’ll have some beautiful views of the canyon you were just in. The trail is mostly moderate until the end, where there is a quick 600 foot elevation gain to the waterfall. Eventually you’ll reach the falls which are, as their name suggests, very misty! Be prepared to get wet! After the hot hike, it is a welcomed reprieve.

From San Francisco, the drive is roughly five hours. After a beautiful drive through the western part of Kings Canyon, you’ll end at Road’s End Trailhead, which is where this hike begins.

If you are just day-hiking, and not taking an overnight trip, you do not need a permit to do this hike.

Be sure to pack plenty of water, sunscreen and mosquito repellent. There is a restroom at the trailhead but no water or services."
https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/big-stump-loop--4,1.7,196,0.5–1hr,loop,"The trail around the ""Big Stump"" tells the story of some of the park's history. The Mark Twain Tree was the name of the sequoia that used to stand in the place of the Big Stump. It grew to be 16 feet in diameter! In 1891, the US Army cut down the Mark Twain Tree so that it could be displayed as a spectacle to crowds all over the world. 

This gentle loop is a great hike for families, and is a great way for kids to learn about the importance of trees."
